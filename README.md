Project Title: Personal Portfolio Website

Description:
This project is my personal portfolio website, developed as part of my journey in learning Full Stack Development. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases my skills, projects, and professional experience with a clean and responsive design. Additionally, Iâ€™ve included some advanced features to enhance the functionality and showcase my growing knowledge of backend technologies.

Key features include:

Custom-designed layout: A visually appealing, user-friendly design with a focus on simplicity and modern aesthetics.
Responsive design: Optimized for seamless performance on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Interactive elements: JavaScript-powered features like dynamic scrolling, smooth transitions, and interactive forms.
Footer contact form: A fully functional form that enables visitors to reach out directly.
Introduction to RESTful APIs: Integrated basic knowledge of REST APIs for handling user input and data (learning in progress). This includes setting up endpoints, sending form data, and making HTTP requests, demonstrating my skills in backend technologies.
This portfolio project not only highlights my front-end web development skills but also reflects my continuous learning in Full Stack Development as I work to incorporate backend features and improve my understanding of web technologies.
